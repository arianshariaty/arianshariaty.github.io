In whispers from a distant star, 
I hear words unknown,
beyond comprehension.
Their beauty enthrals, 
Yet
their meaning eludes me, 
slipping through my grasp like shifting sand.
Each syllable a mystery,
I struggle to understand,
But
in the midst of this confusion,
I feel a sense of wonder.
Suddenly, the words change,
it's as if a door has opened to a new world,
where the words fades into memory, 
and the new ones take their place effortlessly, 
like a long-forgotten melody
resurfacing in my mind.
